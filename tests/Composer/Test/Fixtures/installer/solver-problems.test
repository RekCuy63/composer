Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - The requested package unstable/package could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
  Problem 2
    - The requested package bogus/pkg could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
  Problem 3
    - Installation request for requirer/pkg 1.* -> satisfiable by requirer/pkg[1.0.0].
    - requirer/pkg 1.0.0 requires dependency/pkg 1.0.0 -> no matching package found.
  Problem 4
    - stable-requiree-excluded/pkg is locked to version 1.0.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - Same name, can only install one of: stable-requiree-excluded/pkg[1.0.1, 1.0.0].
    - Installation request for stable-requiree-excluded/pkg 1.0.1 -> satisfiable by stable-requiree-excluded/pkg[1.0.1].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.
