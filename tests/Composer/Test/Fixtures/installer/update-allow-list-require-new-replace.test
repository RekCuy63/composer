If a new requirement cannot be installed on a partial update due to replace, there should be a suggestion to use --with-all-dependencies

Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - current/dep is locked to version 1.0.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - new/pkg[1.0.0] cannot be installed as that would require removing current/dep[1.0.0]. new/pkg replaces current/dep and thus cannot coexist with it.
    - Root composer.json requires new/pkg 1.* -> satisfiable by new/pkg[1.0.0].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies to allow updates and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
