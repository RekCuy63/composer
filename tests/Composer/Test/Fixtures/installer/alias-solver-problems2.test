Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - locked/pkg is locked to version dev-master and an update of this package was not requested.
    - locked/pkg dev-master requires locked/dependency 1.0.0 -> found locked/dependency[1.0.0] in lock file but not in remote repositories, make sure you avoid updating this package to keep the one from lock file.
  Problem 2
    - locked/pkg dev-master requires locked/dependency 1.0.0 -> found locked/dependency[1.0.0] in lock file but not in remote repositories, make sure you avoid updating this package to keep the one from lock file.
    - Root composer.json requires locked/pkg *@dev -> satisfiable by locked/pkg[dev-master].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies to allow updates and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
